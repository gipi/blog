Here we are with another experiment in reusing otherwise trash-destined
electronics material, this episode we are going to refurbish a keyboard,
from the recovering of the internal "matrix" to the design of the PCB destined
as the controller board, to finally reworking of an existing firmware to create
a new USB keyboard.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

The keyboard under recovery is the following

![keyboard](/images/keyboard/keyboard.jpg)

extracted from an HP pavillon, model AT8A. It has a ribbon cable with 26 pins
and pitch of 1.0mm.

## Matrix recovery

The underlying working of a keyboard is described by a matrix of nodes
corresponding to each key; a set of signals act as inputs (for convention I identify them
as the rows of the matix) and the remaining as outputs (columns):
when a key is pressed the corresponding couple of input/output lines (row/column)
are connected allowing to detect the event. 

The algorithm used to implement in hardware the mechanism just described
is to start with all the input lines with the same logic level and then change
only one input signal at the time, with the remaining unaltered. Each time the
output lines are checked for changes and recorded. When all the input signals
have been acted upon the algorithm use the row/column couple to understand the
key pressed and translates that in keyboard scancodes to send via ``USB``.

The first step to reuse the keyboard is to recostruct the internal matrix using
the algorithm described above: in order to do that I'm using the
[following program](https://github.com/gipi/electronics-notes/blob/master/AVR/KeyboardMatrixRecovery/KeyboardMatrixRecovery.ino), in this case I'm using the
Arduino Mega because of the big number of available pins: I'm using a
breakout board as adapter to connect the FPC cable to the pins 22-51 of the
ArduinoÂ·

```c++
/*
 * KEYBOARD MATRIX RECOVERY
 * ------------------------
 *
 * Press a key in you keyboard and see which connections are activated.
 *
 * Since we cannot read reliably without using pull up we need
 * to set one pin to output LOW and the other to input with a
 * pull up enabled. In this way when the key is pressed the input
 * should read low. 
 *
 * Originally designed for the Arduino Mega.
 * 
 */

#define N_PINS(_p) (sizeof(_p)/sizeof(_p[0]))
/*
 * The connector I'm using has 30 pins, modify as needed.
 */
unsigned int pins[] {
  22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,
  32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41,
  42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51,
};


struct _signals {
  unsigned int lines[2];
  bool was_activated;
  bool activated;
} signals;


/*
 * Here we setup only the serial.
 */
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println(" --[Start keyboard matrix recovery ]--");
}


void set_input(unsigned int pinInputIndex)  {
  pinMode(pins[pinInputIndex], OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(pins[pinInputIndex], LOW);
}

void set_outputs(unsigned int pinInputIndex) {
  unsigned int cycle;
  for (cycle = 0 ; cycle < N_PINS(pins) ; cycle++) {
    if (cycle == pinInputIndex) {
      continue;
    }
    // here we need the pullup otherwise the reading will be floating
    pinMode(pins[cycle], INPUT_PULLUP);
  }
}

void look_for_signal(unsigned int inputPinIndex) {
  unsigned int cycle;
  for (cycle = inputPinIndex + 1 ; cycle < N_PINS(pins) ; cycle++) {

    unsigned value = digitalRead(pins[cycle]);
    if (value == LOW) {// since we are using pull ups from the input side we need to look for LOW level
      signals.lines[0]= inputPinIndex;
      signals.lines[1] = cycle;
      signals.activated = true;
    }
  }
}


void try_combination(unsigned int inputPinIndex) {
  set_input(inputPinIndex);
  set_outputs(inputPinIndex);

  look_for_signal(inputPinIndex);  
}

/*
 * We simply communicate the key pressed using a raw packet
 * having the format
 * 
 *    [KEY][unsigned int][unsigned int]
 */
void communicate_signal() {
  // output a key only if the signal is activated now but not the previous time
  if (!(signals.activated && !signals.was_activated))
    return;
  Serial.print("KEY");
  Serial.write(signals.lines[0]);
  Serial.write(signals.lines[1]);
}

/*
 * Here we are looping over all the combination of input/output pairs to
 * find possibly connections.
 */
void loop() {
  signals.activated = false;
  unsigned int inputPinIndex;
  for (inputPinIndex = 0 ; inputPinIndex < N_PINS(pins) ; inputPinIndex++) {
    try_combination(inputPinIndex);
  }

  communicate_signal();

  signals.was_activated = signals.activated;
}
```

From pressing any key in order, I obtain the following array contaning all the
couple of pins that each key triggers (reworked to be used directly in python)


```python
>>> keys = [tuple(sorted(_)) for _ in keys]
>>> keys = [
  (25,15), (14,13), (17,13), (18,13), (25,13), (17,16), (18,16), (25,16), (16,14), (17, 4), (18, 4), (25, 4), (14, 4), (25, 9), (14, 5), (25, 2), (14, 2),
  (17,15), (23,15), (23,16), (23,13), (23,12), (17,12), (17,10), (23,10), (23, 9), (23, 4), (23, 3), (17, 3), (14, 3), (25, 5), (18, 2),
  (18,15), (24,15), (24,16), (24,13), (24,12), (18,12), (18,10), (24,10), (24, 9), (24, 4), (24, 3), (18, 3), (18, 9), (21, 5), (17, 2),
  (15,14), (21,15), (21,16), (21,13), (21,12), (25,12), (25,10), (21,10), (21, 9), (21, 4), (21, 3), (25, 3), (17, 5), (21, 2),
  (22,20), (17, 9), (20,15), (20,16), (20,13), (20,12), (14,12), (14,10), (20,10), (20, 9), (20, 4), (20, 3), (24,22), (24, 5), (20, 2),
  (19,18), (17,11), (25, 8), (23, 6), (20, 5), (14, 6), (17, 7), (21,19), (24, 2), (23, 5), (23, 2),
]
```

I created simple macro to massage the data

```python
>>> get = lambda x: set([_ for _ in keys if _[1] == x or _[0] == x])
>>> get(2)
{(14, 2), (17, 2), (18, 2), (20, 2), (21, 2), (23, 2), (24, 2), (25, 2)}
```

so to have the list of how many node each key determines:

```python
>>> combinations = [(_, len(get(_))) for _ in range(30)]
>>> combinations
[(0, 11),
 (1, 11),
 (2, 11),
 (3, 2),
 (4, 11),
 (5, 11),
 (6, 2),
 (7, 10),
 (8, 12),
 (9, 8),
 (10, 8),
 (11, 10),
 (12, 8),
 (13, 8),
 (14, 1),
 (15, 8),
 (16, 7),
 (17, 1),
 (18, 1),
 (19, 2),
 (20, 7),
 (21, 8),
 (22, 8),
 (23, 8),
 (24, 0),
 (25, 0),
 (26, 0),
 (27, 0),
 (28, 0),
 (29, 0)]
>>> len([line for line, count in combinations if count != 0])
24
```

Since I'm looking for "round numbers" it's interesting to see that a couple of signals are
linked to 8 others, but the real **pro-gamer move** is looking for signals that have
more than eight relations:

```python
>>> inputs = set([line for line, count in combinations if count > 8])
>>> inputs
{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11}
>>> unused = set([line for line, count in combinations if count == 0])
>>> total = set(range(30))
>>> outputs = total - inputs - unused
>>> len(outputs)
16
>>> outputs
{3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23}
```

after analyzing I can split the matrix with the following scheme of 8 inputs and 16 outputs

|             |   |   |   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
|-------------|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **Rows**    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 4  | 5  | 7  | 8  | 11 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
| **Columns** | 3 | 6 | 9 | 10 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 |

**NOTE:** although there are \\(8*16 = 128\\) possible keys, only 87 are used,
so some signals are underused.

## Controller board design and firmware

Since my intention is to use the ATMega32U4 (the main advantage is the builtin
USB) I need to find a way to minimize pins usage: 24 pins are not available in
this chip so I decideded to use 8 pins for the inputs, in particular the bank
identified with ``PORTD`` so to access them with a single register (in this chip
only ``PORTB`` and ``PORTB`` are "complete" and ``PORTB`` will be used for the
``SPI`` communication); the remaining 16, the output pins, will be handled
via two daisy-chained shift registers (the [74HC165](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/sn74hc165.pdf))
communicating via ``SPI`` protocol.

The pinout of the shift register is the following

{{% pyplots %}}
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')

import schemdraw
import schemdraw.elements as elm

d = schemdraw.Drawing()

d += elm.IcDIP(pins=16)\
    .label('$Vcc$', loc='p16') \
    .label('$GND$', loc='p8') \
    .label('$SH/\overline{LD}$', loc='p1') \
    .label('$SER$', loc='p10') \
    .label('$CLK$', loc='p2') \
    .label('$CLK INH$', loc='p15') \
    .label('$Q_H$', loc='p9') \
    .label('$\overline{Q}_H$', loc='p7') \
    .label('$D0$', loc='p11') \
    .label('$D1$', loc='p12') \
    .label('$D2$', loc='p13') \
    .label('$D3$', loc='p14') \
    .label('$D4$', loc='p3') \
    .label('$D5$', loc='p4') \
    .label('$D6$', loc='p5') \
    .label('$D7$', loc='p6')

d.draw()
{{% /pyplots %}}

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ``Vcc`` | positive power supply (up to 6V)|
| ``GND`` | negative rail |
| ``SH/~LD`` | Shift/Load |
| ``CLK`` | clock for the shifting |
| ``CLK INH`` | must be tied low to enable clock |
| ``Q_H`` | serial output |
| ``SER`` | serial input |
| ``Dx`` | paraller inputs |


Reading the chip
[datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7766-8-bit-AVR-ATmega16U4-32U4_Datasheet.pdf)
at section 17, and the application note
[AVR151: Setup and Use of the SPI](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/Atmel-2585-Setup-and-Use-of-the-SPI_ApplicationNote_AVR151.pdf),
I have all the information needed to interact with the ``SPI`` subsystem. The
pin needed on the ATMega32U4 are the following

| Signal | pin | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| ``SS`` | ``PB0`` | chip select |
| ``SCK`` | ``PB1`` | clock |
| ``MOSI`` | ``PB2`` | Master Output Slave Input |
| ``MISO`` | ``PB3`` | Master Input Slave Output |

For my use case the ``MOSI`` is not necessary since we are not going to communicate
data to the shift register but I don't think is possible to reuse anyway. For
latching the data on the shift registers the ``SS`` signal is used.

This below is the schematics of the board

![](/images/keyboard/controller.svg)

I'll complete the post once that I'll send the board to manifacture and I tested
it.

For the firmware I re-used the code from [kmani314/ATMega32u4-HID-Keyboard](https://github.com/kmani314/ATMega32u4-HID-Keyboard)
reworking the matrix-related code to use SPI as described above; the final code
with the board files are in my fork at
[gipi/ATMega32u4-HID-Keyboard](https://github.com/gipi/ATMega32u4-HID-Keyboard).
There isn't very much to say about it, I think it's a pretty standard code to
implement a ``USB`` device.
