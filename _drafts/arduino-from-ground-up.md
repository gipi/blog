The physical arduino is a development board built around the chip ATMega328

## Pins

There are two kinds of pins

 - digital: I/O that read/write 0 and 1 values
 - analog: when in reading mode (``analogRead()``) they are ``ADC`` but in writing mode (``analogWrite()``) they output ``PWM`` signals

### ADC

### Timers

### Interrupts

## SDRAM

## Flash
