The complete (python) dependencies are indicated in 'scripts/dependencies.txt'
and can be used by pip with the following command

to install all.


# DEPLOY

To do this, you need a shell account (ssh maybe) so to manage the following
commands

  $ python manage.py bootstrap

  $ mkdir media/js media/TeX media/uploads media/fonts
  $ wget <jquery URL> -O media/js/jquery.js
  $ wget <some URL pointed by link on http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html>

If you need to create an alternative stylesheet for the code
embedded in the pages yu have to execute the following command

  $ pygmentize -S friendly -f html > <project_root>/media/css/native.css


In order to use alternative settings for your site, you can use
a 'local_settings.py' file.


# HACKING

The code for this project is contained in a git repository hosted by gitorious
and can be cloned with

  git clone git://gitorious.org/yet-another-django-blog/yet-another-django-blog.git

The development model which I (hope to) follow is to use this branching model

  - master	stable branch
  - next	development branch, when ready it's merged in master
  - <whatever>	feature branch, branch off from next and when ready it's merged
              	in next.
